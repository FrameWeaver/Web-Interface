            The research presents an innovative solution for automating the generation of storyboards from screenplays through the integration of advanced AI technologies. By taking a screenplay as input, the system utilizes cutting-edge neural networks to recognize characters and objects, enhancing scene comprehension. A refined Bi LSTM model is employed to extract the nuanced emotional tones embedded within each scene, providing valuable insights into character dynamics and narrative depth. Through the application of regular expressions, key scene attributes such as date, time, and location are extracted to establish contextual relevance. BART, a transformer-based model, is then utilized to generate concise summaries of each scene, facilitating efficient comprehension. Continuity and coherence are further maintained through script summarization and tag extraction from the Movie Plot Synopses with Tags dataset, ensuring a smooth transition between scenes. These extracted features are structured into a coherent prompt using Prompt\_Diffusion-v0.1, facilitating seamless integration into the subsequent creative phase. Finally, a stable diffusion model is employed to generate scene-by-scene storyboards, incorporating all extracted elements to streamline the visual storytelling process. This comprehensive approach not only automates tedious tasks but also enhances creativity and efficiency in storyboard creation.
